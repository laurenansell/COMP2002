# COMP2002
This repository was created for the materials for COMP2002. 

As with most coding exercises, there is more than one way to complete the exercises given on the lab sheets and for the assessment. 

Examples take from:

- An Introduction to Statsitical Learning
- CNN example by de Abreu e Lima, F (2018). poissonisfish: Convolutional Neural Networks in R. From https://poissonisfish.com/2018/07/08/convolutional-neural-networks-in-r/
